### General Introduction to Python

## Some important notes about Python

'''
1. Python is a high level Programming Language
2. Python was originally developed by Guido Van Rossum in 1989. But Python came into the real world in 1991.
3. Its name was derived from The Monty Python Circus .
4. Guido Van Rossum developed python by taking into account the other languages. He took the following
    features from Different languages.
    a ) Functional Programming Features from C programming language.
    b ) Scripting Language Features from Perl
    c ) Object Oriented Programming Features from C++
    d ) Modular Programming Features from Modula-3

USES OF PYTHON 

1. In web development
2. In AI
3. In Machine Learning
4. In Data Science
5. In Data Visualization
6. In IOT
7. In App Developement

FEATURES OF PYTHON 

1. Simple and Easy to Learn
2. Interpreted
3. Both Procedure Oriented and Object Oriented
4. Freeware and Open Source and Large Community
5. Platform Independent 
6. Portable
7. Dynamically Types Programming Language
8. Interpreted 
9. Extensible Programming Language
10. Embedded Programming Language
11. Extensive Library 




"Python is platform independent" means that Python code can run on any platform without requiring any modifications to the code.
This is because Python code is interpreted at runtime, and the Python interpreter is available for most operating systems.
So, as long as the appropriate version of the Python interpreter is installed on a particular platform,
 the same Python code should run on that platform without any changes.


 "Python has portability" means that Python code can be easily moved or copied from one platform to another.
This is because Python code is usually stored in text files that can be easily edited and transferred between different platforms.
  Additionally, Python libraries and modules are designed to be cross-platform,
so they can be used on different platforms without requiring any modifications.



LIMITATIONS OF PYTHON 

1. Performance wise python is not up to the mark as python is a interpreted language.
2. Python is not used to develop mobile applications.



FLAVORS OF PYTHON 

1. Cpython  : It is the standard flavor of python used to work with C programming language. 
2. Jpython  : It is used to work with Java programming language.
3. PyPy : It is faster than python as it uses the JIT compiler.
4. ironPython : It is made to work with C# programming language.
5. RubyPython : It is made to work with Ruby Programming language.
6. AncondaPython : It is made to work with large volumes of data.


Python Versions : 
1.0 - 1994
2.0 - 2000
3.0 - 2008




IDENTIFIERS 

A name in python program is known as the identifier.
It can be a class Name or Module name or function name or a variable name.

RULES FOR DEFINING IDENTIFIERS IN PYTHON 

1. The only allowed characters are : 
  a ) numbers 
  b ) _ 
  c ) alphabets 

  # Special Characters are not allowed.
  
2. Identifiers cannot start with a digit in python.

3. Identifiers in python are case sensitive.

4. We cannot use reserve words (keywords) as identifiers in python.

5. There is no length limit to identifiers in python.

6. Special Characters are not allowed in Identifiers.

7. If an identifier starts with a '_' in python, it means it is private
